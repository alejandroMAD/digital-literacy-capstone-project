# Digital and Coding Literacy Capstone Project

Demonstrate what you have learned about HTML and CSS by replicating the CodePen.io homepage – landing page section.

Capstone Project Directions:  

Demonstrate what you have learned about HTML and CSS by replicating the CodePen.io homepage using the image below.

CodePen.io is a relatively simple webpage that combines a number of things you already know, such as working with images, creating buttons, and text fields.

You can use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your text editor. It is free, lightweight, and easy to use. Otherwise, you can use any other text editor you prefer.  

Include these elements:

Navbar that includes “Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron(does not need to actually drop down)

Images - use available tools to recreate colors, etc.

Don’t worry about replicating any functionality features such as drop-down, scrolling, etc. Simply replicate the landing page.

The output should look something like this:

Scoring criteria:

-Coding runs without errors

-Coding produces a replica that:

-Includes all required elements

-Accurate representation of the CodePen.io homepage

After you have completed this assignment you will need to reach out to a Mentor in the Support App so that they can verify that your assignment is correctly completed.
